# Deloitte-virtual-Internship-Forage

## Task 1
We have signed a new account - Daikibo Industrials, a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. They needed assistance with a variety of problems and were impressed to find out Deloitte could help in all verticals.

Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need your help to combine the two.

Task is to get acquainted with the 2 data formats by exploring the files and explore the target unified format by looking at the json file.

## Task 2
Having the data unification algorithm, Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company.
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. 
Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

In which location did machines break the most?
What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

The second task is to analyse the telemetry data collected by Daikibo (and unified with your algorithm) in a software called Tableau.

## Task 3

To write a formal & informative, but short development proposal for the following project:

Private dashboard with health status of the 9 machines in each of Daikibo's 4 factories, for which they collect telemetry.
Access to the page happens only within client's Intranet.
Authentication is synced to internal authentication server (users can leverage their company-wide accounts).
The dashboard consists of a single page, listing the current statuses of all monitored devices.
The view is collapsible/expandable at a factory level, as well as device level (showing history of statuses). 

## Task 4

A big news publication has revealed sensitive private information of Daikibo Industrials' – a production problem has caused their assembly lines to stop, threatening the smooth operation of supply chains relying on Daikibo’s products. The client suspects the security of their new status board may have been breached.

The job is to:
1) Determine if the alleged breach could have happened from an attacker on the Internet, directly (no access to Daikibo's VPN).
2) Inspect a web_requests.log file (listing only data from a period when the alleged attack has to have happened): spot suspicious requests.

## Task 5

An excel file containing 3 columns:

Factory
Job Role
Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)

Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score in those 3 types:
Fair (+-10)
Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
